While building this calculator, I used css grid to align the buttons how I wanted them. To make the calculator functional, within the logic, I used Object Oriented Programming. All of the logic behind this calculator is inside of a class/constructor where I created an object from the class, and passed in the appropriate classes and IDs for the elements needed to build this project.

## Optimizations

If/When I improve this project, I want to prevent the user from clicking on an operator button if they haven't click on a number button yet. I also want to make it to where you can only click on an operator once in a calculation. Lastly, I would want to add keyboard functionality as well.

## Lessons Learned:

I gained more knowledge on Object Oriented Programming and how it works in Javascript versus other programming languages. I learned how to declare private variables inside of a class which I didn't know had a specific syntax in Javascript. I also learned how to use css grid and how to make one of the buttons span two columns.
